# Ansible Inventory File for Windows Domain Environment
################################################################################
#
# Purpose:
# This inventory file defines the Windows hosts that Ansible will manage and their
# roles in the domain environment.
#
# Structure:
# - Groups are defined in square brackets [group_name]
# - Hosts are listed under their respective groups
# - Child groups are defined using [group:children]
# - Group variables are defined using [group:vars]
#
# Important Notes:
# 1. Replace the example hostnames with your actual server hostnames or IP addresses
# 2. Ensure DNS resolution is working for the hostnames used
# 3. All Windows hosts must be configured for WinRM access
